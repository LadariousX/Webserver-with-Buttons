    <h3>My back pages, played at maddison square garden</h3>

    <p1 class="poem">
            Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps<br>
            Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps<br>
            "We'll meet on edges, soon, " said I, proud 'neath heated brow<br>
            Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br>
            Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, "rip down all hate, " I screamed<br>
            Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed<br>
            Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow<br>
            Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br>
            Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy<br>
            To memorizing politics of ancient history<br>
            Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow<br>
            Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now<br>
            A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool<br>
            Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school<br>
            "Equality, " I spoke the word as if a wedding vow<br>
            Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
            <br>In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
            <br>Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
            <br>My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
            <br>Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
            <br>Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
            <br>Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
            <br>Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow
            <br>Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now
